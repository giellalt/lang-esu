##  ALLOMORPH OPERATORS 
 * **(e)** =   is used only when a strong base-final consonant is kept
 * **(g)** =   is used with bases ending in two vowels
 * **(ng)** =   is used with bases ending in a vowel
 * **(r)** =   is used with bases ending in te, and by some speakers in e not preceded by t
 * **(s)** =   is used with bases ending in a vowel
 * **(t)** =   is used with bases ending in a consonant
 * **(u)** =   is used with bases ending in a consonant or e
 * **(g/t)** =   (g)(t) 
 * **(r/l)** =   @+(r/l)i-1 to become or cause to become V # used with adjectival verbs; the r is used with bases ending in a prime vowel, and the l with bases ending in e (but (special) te changes to l)
 * **(u/i)** =   consonant and e-ending bases (not te) use u ; te bases use i

# OPERATORS 
 * **@¹** =   (@n postbase) drops t only when the t is preceded by a fricative; the fricative is then written devoiced
 * **@²** =   (@i|m|ng|t|v) drops t when the t is preceded by a fricative which is then written devoiced, and changes t to s (y in HBC) when the t is preceded by a vowel, unless the base is marked with °, in which case t is changed to l
 * **@³** =   (@(u)c|t) drops t when the t is preceded by a fricative which then becomes voiced, and changes t to y if preceded by a vowel, but to s (except in HBC) if the t is geminated on the base, unless the base is marked with °, in which case t is changed to l
 * **@⁴** =   (@ng|k|t) changes t to s (y in HBC) whether preceded by a vowel or fricative, unless the base is marked with °, in whcih case t is changed to l
 * **@⁵** =   (@c|l|ll|k|ng|p|t) drops any t
 * **@ˡ** =   (@l postbases) tl->ll
 * **@ˁ** =   (@ur postbases) te->q                    
 * **@ʸ** =   (@y postbases) ty->c 
 * **k̲ q̲ g̲ r̲ g̲g̲ r̲r̲** =          velar/uvular (front/back velar) assimilation
