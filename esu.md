# Central Yupik description 

All documents in one file



* Sets for POS sub-categories

* Sets for Semantic tags

* Sets for Morphosyntactic properties

* Sets for verbs

- V is all readings with a V tag in them, REAL-V should
be the ones without an N tag following the V.  
The REAL-V set thus awaits a fix to the preprocess V ... N bug.

* The set COPULAS is for predicative constructions

* NP sets defined according to their morphosyntactic features

* The PRE-NP-HEAD family of sets

These sets model noun phrases (NPs). The idea is to first define whatever can
occur in front of the head of the NP, and thereafter negate that with the
expression **WORD - premodifiers**.

The set **NOT-NPMOD** is used to find barriers between NPs.
Typical usage: ... (*1 N BARRIER NPT-NPMOD) ...
meaning: Scan to the first noun, ignoring anything that can be
part of the noun phrase of that noun (i.e., "scan to the next NP head")

* Miscellaneous sets

* Border sets and their complements

* Syntactic sets

These were the set types.

## HABITIVE MAPPING

* **hab1** 

* **hab2** 

* **hab3** (<hab> @ADVL>) for hab-actor and hab-case; if leat to the right, and Nom to the right of leat. Lots of restrictions.

* **habNomLeft** 

* **hab4** 	

* **hab6** 

* **hab7** 

* **hab8** This is not HAB
* **hab5**  This is not HAB

* **habDain** (<hab> @ADVL>) for (Pron Dem Pl Loc) if leat followed by Nom to the right

* **habGen** (<hab> @<ADVL) hab for Gen; if Gen is located in the end of the sentence and Nom is sentence initial

* **spred<obj** (@SPRED<OBJ) for Acc; the object of an SPRPED. Not to be mistaken with OPRED. If SPRED is to the left, and copulas is to the left of it. Nom or Hab are found sentence initially.

* **Hab<spred** (@<SPRED) for Nom; if copulas, goallut or jápmit is FMAINV and habitive or human Loc is found to the left. OR: if Ill or @Pron< followed by HAB are found to the left.

* **Hab>Advlcase<spred** (<ext> @<SUBJ) for Nom; it allows adverbials with Ill/Loc/Com/Ess to be found inbetween HAB and <ext>.

* **Nom>Advlcase<spred** (<ext> @<SUBJ) for Nom; it allows adverbials with Ill/Loc/Com/Ess to be found inbetween Nom and <ext> @<SUBJ.

* **<spred** (<ext> @<SUBJ) for Nom; if copulas to the left, and some kind of adverb, N Loc, time related word or Po to the left of it. OR: if Ill or @Pron< to the left, followed by copulas and the before mentioned to the left of copulas. 

* **<spred** (<ext> @<SUBJ) for Nom, but not for Pers. To the left boahtit or heaŋgát as MAINV, and futher to the left is some kind of place related word, or time related word

* **<spredQst1** (<ext> @<SUBJ) for Nom in a typically question sentence; if A) Hab, some kind of place word, Po or Nom to the left, and Qst followed by copulas to the left. B) same as a, only the Qst-pcle is attached to copulas. C) Qst to the left, with copulas to its left, but not if two Nom:s are found somewhere to the right. D) copulas to the left, and BOS to the left. E) Loc or Ill to the left, and Loc or Hab to the left of this, Qst and copulas to the left. F) Num @>N to the left, Hab, some kind of place word, Po or Nom to the left, and Qst followed by copulas to the left. NOTE) for all these rules; human, Loc or Sem/Plc not allowed to the right.

* **<spredQst2** (@<SPRED) for Nom; in a typically question sentence; differs from <spredQst1 by not beeing as restricted to the right. Though you are not allowed to be Pers or human.

* **Nom<spredQst** (@<SPRED) for Nom; in a typically question sentence. Differs from <spredQst2 by letting Nom be found between SPRED and copulas

* **<spred** (@<SPRED) for A Nom or N Nom if; the subject Nom is on the same side of copulas as you: on the right side of copulas

* **<spredVeara** (@<SPRED) for veara + Nom; if genitive immediately to the right, and intransitive mainverb to the right of genitive

* **leftCop<spred** (@<SPRED) for Nom; if copulas is the main verb to the left, and there is no Ess found to the left of cop (note that Loc is allowed between target and cop). OR: if you are Coll or Sem/Group with copulas to your left.

* **NumTime** (@<SPRED) for A Nom

* **<spredSg** (@<SPRED) for Sg Nom	

* **<spredPg** (@<SPRED) for Pl Nom

* **<spred** (@<SPRED) for N Ess

* **spredEss>** (@SPRED>) for N Ess; if copulas to the right of you, and if an NP with nom-case first one to your left.

* **GalleSpred>** (@SPRED>) for Num Nom; if sentence initial

* **spredSgMII>** (@SPRED>)

* **r492>** (@SPRED>) for Interr Gen; consisting only of negations. You are not allowed to be MII. You are not allowed to have an adjective or noun to yor right. You are not allowed to have a verb to your right; the exception beeing an aux.

for text-to-speech systems.

For example:

* s.:syntynyt # ;  
* os.:omaa% sukua # ;  
* v.:vuosi # ;  
* v.:vuonna # ;  
* esim.:esimerkki # ;

# Tokeniser for esu

Usage:
```
$ make
$ echo "ja, ja" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "Juos gorreválggain lea (dárbbašlaš) deavdit gáibádusa boasttu olmmoš, man mielde lahtuid." | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "(gáfe) 'ja' ja 3. ja? ц jaja ukjend \"ukjend\"" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
$ echo "márffibiillagáffe" | hfst-tokenise --giella-cg tokeniser-disamb-gt-desc.pmhfst
```

Pmatch documentation:
<https://github.com/hfst/hfst/wiki/HfstPmatch>

Characters which have analyses in the lexicon, but can appear without spaces
before/after, that is, with no context conditions, and adjacent to words:
* Punct contains ASCII punctuation marks
* The symbol after m-dash is soft-hyphen `U+00AD`
* The symbol following {•} is byte-order-mark / zero-width no-break space
`U+FEFF`.

Whitespace contains ASCII white space and
the List contains some unicode white space characters
* En Quad U+2000 to Zero-Width Joiner U+200d'
* Narrow No-Break Space U+202F
* Medium Mathematical Space U+205F
* Word joiner U+2060

Apart from what's in our morphology, there are
1. unknown word-like forms, and
2. unmatched strings
We want to give 1) a match, but let 2) be treated specially by
`hfst-tokenise -a`
Unknowns are made of:
* lower-case ASCII
* upper-case ASCII
* select extended latin symbols
ASCII digits
* select symbols
* Combining diacritics as individual symbols,
* various symbols from Private area (probably Microsoft),
so far:
* U+F0B7 for "x in box"

## Unknown handling
Unknowns are tagged ?? and treated specially with `hfst-tokenise`
hfst-tokenise --giella-cg will treat such empty analyses as unknowns, and
remove empty analyses from other readings. Empty readings are also
legal in CG, they get a default baseform equal to the wordform, but
no tag to check, so it's safer to let hfst-tokenise handle them.

Finally we mark as a token any sequence making up a:
* known word in context
* unknown (OOV) token in context
* sequence of word and punctuation
* URL in context

* * *
